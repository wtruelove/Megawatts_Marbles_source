    The makefile and all source code was tested on the following architectures and OS:

        Operating System: Linux Mint 20.2
                  Kernel: Linux 5.4.0-84-generic
            Architecture: x86-64

        Operating System: Windows 10 Home
                 Version: 21H1 (build 19043.1586)
            Architecture: 64-bit OS, x64-based processor

    The following compilers were used:

        Linux:      g++ (Ubuntu 9.3.0-17ubuntu1~20.04) 9.3.0
        Windows:    g++ (Rev1, Built by MSYS2 project) 11.3.0

    The version of SFML used was 2.5.1. SFML is cross-platform (see https://www.sfml-dev.org/),
and so should compile on macOS as well (although this has not been tested). Apparently SFML
support for Android and iOS is coming too, so a future port to mobile is a definite maybe =P.

    If you're looking for the static build of Megawatts & Marbles for 64-bit Windows, you can
find it at https://github.com/wtruelove/Megawatts_Marbles_Windows_build

    In the directory for this project, you should find this README, a license file, a
makefile, and the following sub-directories:

    /assets     (to hold various game assets)
    /header     (to hold header files)
    /source     (to hold source files)


-------- notes on making and running (OS independent) --------

The provided makefile can be used by way of simply

    $   make clean all

this will clean the game directory, create the required sub-directories, and build the game. To run the game, simply

    $   make run


-------- notes on SFML installation (Linux Mint 20.2) --------


---- INSTALL USING apt ----

ref: https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.5/start-linux.php

    $   sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev

headers install to /usr/include/SFML/ by default
libraries install to /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ by default

You may also need to install g++. This can be done by way of

    $   sudo apt-get install build-essential g++
